You may operate your own trustgator instance and describe it as 'a trustgator' (but not *the* trustgator) as long as your fork is open source. If your fork has worse privacy guarantees than the main codebase you must *either* make those changes clear to the user in the signup process *or* not use the trustgator name anywhere on your site.

I may in my sole discretion change the license to MIT in the future.
