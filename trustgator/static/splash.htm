<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The overall goal here is to understand how the people in your network view a particular piece of information.</p>

<h2>Trust features</h2>
<h4>Assertions</h4>

<p>Users can 'assert' claims about articles which are visible in the article's thread. Assertions have an attached <span class="badge badge-secondary">topic</span> badge so you may end up trusting a certain user on 'long haul trucking' but not on 'modern dance'.</p>

<p>Logged-in users will see activity from their trust network as an overlay on posted links</p>

<h4>Vouches</h4>

<p>Users can 'vouch' for assertions that interest them. Vouches can be positive but also neutral i.e. 'interesting but not sure' or negative i.e. 'disagree'. The goal isn't to hide content you disagree with.</p>

<h4>Surfaced articles</h4>

<p>The articles on a user's homepage are those with recent assert/vouch activity from their 2-hop network (i.e. users you've vouched and users your vouchees have vouched)</p>

<!-- <h4>RFCs</h4>

Users can 'ping' their trust network with a request for comment. This alerts the network to look at an article and comment on it.
